#summary Things that will eventually come to this project.

= Tests =

I plan to create & port more tests to JSBox2D. I will scour the web for other language tests and make versions of them for this.

= ECMAScript 6 =

When ES6 is widespread, an ES6 version will be available as well. It will likely be alongside the ES5 version, but I am not positive yet.

= JSON =

JS is one of the best languages for use of JSON - as such, I will be implementing a JSON serializer of Box2D worlds in here. I will also be submitting the code (maybe only the read part) for use in the C++ version as a contribution.

= Dump =

At the moment, the Dump feature from C++ is not supported. This feature may return in the future (with both JS and C++ dialects available for dumping).
